import Callout from "../../../components/Callout";

Our [`@knocklabs/react-notification-feed`](https://github.com/knocklabs/react-notification-feed) library lets you create notification experiences using Knock's notification feed APIs in your React Native application.

<Callout
  emoji="ðŸ’¡"
  text={
    "Please note: we don't currently have a set of pre-built components for use within React Native applications. Our existing libraries give you all of the building blocks and manage state for you, but you will need to create your own view components."
  }
/>

The React library is built on top of the `@knocklabs/client` JS SDK and includes that library as an implicit dependency.

**You can also use the library to build:**

- [Floating notification feeds](/in-app-ui/react/feed)
- [Real-time notification toasts](/in-app-ui/react/toasts)
- [Notification inboxes](/in-app-ui/react/inbox)
- [Custom notification UI](/in-app-ui/react/custom-notifications-ui)
- [Notification preferences](/in-app-ui/react/preferences)
