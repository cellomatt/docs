In this guide you’ll learn how to use Knock to send notifications to Discord.

We’ll cover:

- Setting up a bot and app for your Knock integration on Discord
- Setting up the Discord channel and bot Object in Knock 
- Triggering the notification to your Discord channel

Note: this guide assumes you already have an application with an action you want to trigger a workflow in Knock. For this, we'll be using an example app that will trigger a Knock workflow when a user leaves a new comment.

## Part 1: Configuring Discord 
### 1. Create an app and bot on Discord

You'll need to set up a bot and app to handle incoming messages from Knock. You can see the documentation on [creating the bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots) and [creating the app](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (note: you'll need to be logged in to access the applications docs).

### 2. Set OAuth permissions for the bot 

Once you have a bot created for your app in Discord, you can set permissions and authorize it to join your Discord server.

`https://discord.com/developers/applications/<your application id>/oauth2/url-generator`

Within the Application you've created on Discord, find the URL Generator under `OAuth2`. 

> There are two segments here, `Scopes` and `Bot permissions`. 
>
> - A [scope](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/applications#data-models) is a permission granted to a Discord app when it joins a Discord server.
> - [Bot permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bot-authorization-flow) dictate what the bot can do in the server.

The URL Generator will build our bot invitation link for us. Under `Scopes` check "bot" and under `Bot permissions` check "Send Messages". Scroll down and copy the generated URL, and paste it into your browser. You will see a prompt to allow it access to the Discord servers you are an administrator of. Select your desired server and proceed to authorize it.

Now you should see your new bot enter your Discord server! We can move on to configuring your channel in Knock.

## Part 2: Configuring Knock
### 3. Add your Discord channel

For this, you'll need your bot's token. In your Discord account in the browser, navigate back to your bot's settings: `https://discord.com/developers/applications/<your application id>/bot`

If you don't see a token, click "Reset token" and copy the result.

Now you can go to your Knock channels and create a new `Chat` channel, selecting Discord as the type. 

Once it's created, click `Edit configuration` and add the Discord bot token you just created/copied above.
