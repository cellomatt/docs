In this guide youâ€™ll learn how to use Knock to send notifications to Discord.

Weâ€™ll cover:

- Setting up a bot and app for your Knock integration on Discord
- Setting up the Discord channel and bot Object in Knock
- Triggering the notification to your Discord channel

Note: this guide assumes you already have an application with an action you want to trigger a workflow in Knock.

## Part 1: Configuring Discord

### 1. Create an app and bot on Discord

You'll need to set up a bot and app to handle incoming messages from Knock. You can see the documentation on [creating the bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots) and [creating the app](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (note: you'll need to be logged in to access the applications docs).

### 2. Set OAuth permissions for the bot

Once you have a bot created for your app in Discord, you can set permissions and authorize it to join your Discord server.

Within the Application you've created on Discord, find the URL Generator under `OAuth2`. The URL for this is `https://discord.com/developers/applications/<your application id>/oauth2/url-generator`.

<Callout
  emoji="ðŸŒ "
  text={
    <>
      <div className="font-bold">
        {" "}
        There are two segments here, Scopes and Bot permissions.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A{" "}
          <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/applications#data-models">
            scope
          </a>{" "}
          is a permission granted to a Discord app when it joins a Discord
          server.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bot-authorization-flow">
            Bot permissions
          </a>{" "}
          dictate what the bot can do in the server.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
  }
/>

The URL Generator will build our bot invitation link for us. Under `Scopes` check "bot" and under `Bot permissions` check "Send Messages". If you have more advanced use cases, here's where you can set various permissions for your bot, but this is the minimum we need to give it the ability to pass along messages from Knock.

Scroll down and copy the generated URL, and **paste it into your browser**. You will see a prompt to allow it access to the Discord servers you are an administrator of. Select your desired server and proceed to authorize it.

Now you should see your new bot enter your Discord server! We can move on to configuring your channel in Knock.

## Part 2: Configuring Knock

### 1. Add your Discord channel

For this, you'll need your bot's token. In your Discord account in the browser, navigate back to your bot's settings: `https://discord.com/developers/applications/<your application id>/bot`

If you don't see a token, click "Reset token" and copy the result.

Now you can go to your Knock channels and create a new `Chat` channel, selecting Discord as the type.

Once it's created, click `Edit configuration` and paste in the Discord bot token you just created/copied above.

### 2. Identify your bot as an Object

For your bot to be a "recipient" of your workflow and pass messages to your Discord channel, you'll need to identify it as an object in Knock. You can take a look at the [Object documentation here](https://docs.knock.app/reference#objects) to read more about Objects in Knock.

To add this bot as an object, we'll create a unique ID for it and give it a `collection` as well. (You can read more about collections [here](https://docs.knock.app/send-and-manage-data/objects#the-knock-objects-api).)

For this example, let's call our bot `notifications-bot` and its collection will be `projects`. Our API call would look like this:

** Placeholder code snippet **

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  snippet="objects.set"
  title="Send project object to Knock"
/>

```
Method: PUT
URL: `https://api.knock.app/v1/objects/projects/notifications-bot`.
```

If we check the Objects tab in our Knock dashboard, we can see the bot exists there.

![Bot in Objects list](/images/discord_walkthrough/objects-bot-exists.png)

Now we can give it specific channel information so it knows where to post in Discord.

### 3. Set Discord channel data in Knock

For the bot to know what Discord channel it's posting to, we need to get that channel's ID. To do this, open Discord, navigate to `Preferences` in the main menu, and go to the `Advanced` tab under `App Settings`. From here you'll see a toggle for Developer Mode.

![Turn on developer mode in Discord](/images/discord_walkthrough/dev-mode-toggle.png)

Make sure that's turned on, then navigate back to your Discord server. Now if you right-click on a channel, you'll see "Copy ID" as an option in the list. Copy the ID for the channel you want to post to. For clarity, we'll call this the `Discord channel ID`.

![Copy Discord channel ID](/images/discord_walkthrough/discord-channel-id.png)

We'll also need the ID for the Knock chat channel we set up in step 3. We'll refer to this as the `Knock chat channel ID`, which you can get in the channels tab of your Knock dashboard.

![Copy Knock chat channel ID](/images/discord_walkthrough/knock-chat-id.png)

Now, we'll need to set channel data for our bot.

** Placeholder code snippet **

<MultiLangCodeBlock snippet="objects.setChannelData" title="Set channel data" />

You can navigate back to your Objects dashboard and verify that your bot has a Discord channel in its channel data tab.

Now we've finished the Knock and Discord configurations and it's time to test triggering a workflow!

## Part 3: Triggering the workflow

We'll navigate back to our example app which will notify Discord users when a new comment is made. We just need to make sure we include our bot as one of the recipients for this notification by including its ID and collection, like in the example below:

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  snippet="workflows.trigger-with-object-as-recipient"
  title="Trigger your workflow"
/>

Now you should be seeing the notifications-bot ping the Discord channel you specified earlier.
