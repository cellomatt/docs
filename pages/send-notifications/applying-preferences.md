title: Applying preferences
---

Knock will automatically applying preferences stored alongside your users when generating
messages. That may mean that because of a users preference settings, no messages
will be sent to a user when a `notify` call is issued.

**Please note: preferences are an active WIP area of our product. This section will be updated as soon as we have more to share.**
