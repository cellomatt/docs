Notification feeds give your users a way inside of your product to see all of their notifications
and activity that has been occurring. The feed is per user and is a reverse chronological list
of the notifications that they have and have not seen.

As well as being an out-of-app notification delivery platform, Knock also gives you the ability
to integrate in-app notification feeds for your users to deliver a best-in-class product
experience.

## Features

The Knock in-app notification feeds feature:

- Real-time updates so that your notifications automatically show up when your users are in your product (via websockets)
- The backend to power your notification feeds, including the scaleable storage to persist your users notifications indefinitely
- Unread badge counts and syncronization across devices
- Pre-built components to get you started quickly (in React JS)
- A complete API and SDK if you want to build custom UI experiences
