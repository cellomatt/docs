Notification feeds give your users a way to see everything they missed since they were last in your product (or a way to see something that's happening elsewhere in your product in real-time). The feed is per user and is a reverse chronological list
of the notifications they've received. 

As well as being an out-of-app notification delivery platform, Knock also gives you the ability
to integrate in-app notification feeds for your users.

## Features

The Knock in-app notification feeds feature:

- Real-time updates so that your notifications automatically show up when your users are in your product (via websockets)
- The backend to power your notification feeds, including the scaleable storage to persist your users notifications indefinitely
- Unread badge counts and syncronization across devices
- Pre-built components to get you started quickly (in React JS)
- A complete API and SDK if you want to build custom UI experiences
