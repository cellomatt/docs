Knock takes the hard work out of managing the many preferences that can be associated with
the notifications within your product.

We're currently hard at work on designing our preference components that you can use to drop into
your application. The goal with this set of components is to give you an instant way to get up-and-running
with advanced preference management for your end users.

Please [contact us](mailto:support@knock.app) if you wish to discuss preferences in more detail and how we can help here.
